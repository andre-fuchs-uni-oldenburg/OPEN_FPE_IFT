% This function calculates the total Entropy of the system or the Shanon entropy for trajectories.
%
% Arguments IN
% uLs = mid-point increment at the start of the cascade trajectory
% uls = mid-point increment at the end of the cascade trajectory
% puL = Probability density function &  uL = is the center of the bin at start of the cascade trajectory
% pul = Probability density function &  ul = is the center of the bin at end of the cascade trajectory
% 
% Arguments OUT
% Ds = Entropy of the system or the Shanon entropy
% The cascade process takes some initial probability s_L = $p(u_L, L)$ and changes to a different 
% final probability s_l = $p(u_\lambda, \lambda)$.
