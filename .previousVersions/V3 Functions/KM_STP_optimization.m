% This function performs the pointwise optimization of Kramers-Moyal coefficients 
% $D^{(1,2)}\left(u_r,r\right)$ at each scale and value of velocity increment to minimize possible 
% uncertainties in the absolute values of the Kramersâ€“Moyal coefficients. The object of this 
% optimization is to find the best Fokker-Planck equation to reproduce the conditional PDF's as 
% these are the essential part of the Markov process. This optimization procedure is proposed in 
% \cite{kleinhans2005iterative,Nawroth2007,Reinke2018} and it includes the reconstruction of the 
% conditional probability density functions $p\left(u_{r'} | u_r \right)$ via the short time 
% propagator \cite{Risken} 
% 
% Arguments IN
% evaluated = struct array calculated in the function 'conditional_moment'
% increment_bin = number of bins
% Fs = Acquisition/Sampling Frequency in Hz
% markov = markov length in number of samples
% data = filtered data 
% m_data = mean of the data
% taylor_L = Taylor length scale in meters
% test_opti = weather to plot or not ==> 'Plot? 1=Yes, 0=No'
% multi_point = weather to do multi-point analysis or not 1=Yes, 0=No
% condition = condition for multi-point analysis
% tol = This input is for multipoint statistics
% min_events = minimum number of events
% tol_opti = Optimization: Tolerance of the range of Kramers-Moyal coefficients in % 
%            It is the percentage(For Ex: 0.1 for 10 percent or 0.2 for 20 percent)of D1 or D2 
%            within these limit which you want to optimize these coeffcients D1 & D2
%
% Arguments OUT
% evaluated = a modified/updated struct 'evaluated' array with optimized value of D1 & D2
